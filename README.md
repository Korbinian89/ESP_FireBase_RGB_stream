# RGB Firebase Stream
Simple FireBase RGB Stream from ESP32. Keep the color of a RGB LED in Firebase cloud storage.\n

All RGB LEDs with WIFI have the same color at the same and change synchronously their color.

# Why?
Your best-buddy-light-companion. If your friend abroad changes the color, yours change as well. Awesome.
